# UCLID5 Tutorial/Publication

The [tutorial](https://github.com/uclid-org/uclid/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.pdf) has a gentle introduction to using UCLID5.

If you use UCLID5 in your work, please cite the following MEMOCODE 2018 paper:

Sanjit A. Seshia and Pramod Subramanyan. <font color="blue">UCLID5: Integrating Modeling, Verification, Synthesis and Learning.</font> [\[HTML\]](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/pubs/b2hd-seshia-memocode18.html)
*Proceedings of the 16th ACM-IEEE International Conference on Formal Methods and Models for System Design (MEMOCODE 2018)*, Beijing, China. October 2018. 

UCLID5 is an evolution of the earlier UCLID modeling and verification system. The UCLID project was one of the first to develop satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers and SMT-based verification methods. Here is the original UCLID paper that appeared at CAV 2002:

Randal E. Bryant, Shuvendu K. Lahiri, and Sanjit A. Seshia. <font color="blue">Modeling and Verifying Systems using a Logic of Counter Arithmetic with Lambda Expressions and Uninterpreted Functions.</font> [\[HTML\]](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/pubs/b2hd-bryant-cav02.html)

# Installation
There are currently two ways to install UCLID5: [downloading the latest pre-build package](#prebuilt) and [building from source](#srcbuild). Please make sure you have all the pre-requisites before proceeding to installation. Due to the nuances in the later Mac OS versions, we prepare separately a compact list of the installation instructions [here](mac-install.md). 

## <a name="prereqs"></a> Pre-requisites

#### 1. [Z3 version 4.8.8.](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases/tag/z3-4.8.8)
You will need the Z3 SMT solver to be installed on your system. Earlier versions of Z3 should work, but the CI is tested with version 4.8.8. uclid5 requires that the Z3 dynamic link library (libz3.so on Unix-like platforms) as well as the dynamic link library for the Z3/Java API (libz3java.so on Unix-like platforms) be in your dynamic library path (`$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Unix-like platforms; just `PATH` on Windows). If compiling from source, the source repository provides an easy way to set up Z3. See the instructions for [compiling from source](#srcbuild) for details.

If you prefer to build Z3 from source, make sure the Z3/Java interface is enabled in your build (typically by passing `--java` to the `mk_make.py` script). To install z3 on Unix-like systems from source, download the source code and run the following:

```bash
python scripts/mk_make.py --java
cd build
make
sudo make install
```

Finally copy the jar file  `path/to/z3/build/com.microsoft.z3.jar` to the dir `path/to/uclid5/lib/com.microsoft.z3.jar`

**If you are using Mac OS X El Capitan or above**, System Integrity Protection is a feature introduced by Apple in OS X El Capitan; it prevents the modifications of system-owned files and directories by any process without a specific ‘entitlement’, even when executed by a root user or a user with root privileges. Since Java is a SIP protected executable, it ignores the user set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, which prevents the system from recognizing the Z3 Dynamic Library. 

To fix this issue, put:
- JNI dynamic link libraries (e.g libz3java.dylib) in:       /Library/Java/Extensions
- non-JNI dynamic link libraries (e.g libz3.dylib) in:      /usr/local/lib

For more information on the resolution of this issue, please refer to:
https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/issues/294

#### 2. [OpenJDK version 8](https://openjdk.java.net/) or [Oracle JDK version 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
**If you are using Mac OS X Mojave or above**, we recommend using Java 11 or earlier. We have found some issues related to the System Integrity Protection when using Catalina or Mojave and later versions of OpenJDK.

## <a name="prebuilt"></a> Download Pre-Built Binaries

Download the latest stable pre-built package from [releases tab](https://github.com/uclid-org/uclid/releases).

## <a name="srcbuild"></a> Building From Source

Or, you could clone this repository and build from source. If you run into problems here, don't forget you can always fall back on the pre-built binaries linked above.

### Pre-requisites
In addition to the prerequisites mentioned [above](#prereqs), please also note the following if compiling from source:

#### 1. Z3 Setup Script

The `get-z3-linux.sh` script in the source repository makes it easy to set up Z3 for use with uclid5. To use the script, simply run `source get-z3-linux.sh` from the root directory of the uclid5 source repository. This script will download Z3 binaries from GitHub and set up your `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` accordingly (it uses `setup-z3-linux.sh` to do the latter). You will need to rerun `setup-z3-linux.sh` (or the commands in it) each time you open a new bash shell, or you can simply source it from your `.profile` or `.bashrc`.

#### 2. [SBT version 1.0 or greater.](http://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Setup.html)
If you intend to build from source, you need to install sbt. You can skip this step if you are using the pre-build binaries. Install instructions for sbt are available at http://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Setup.html

#### 3. CVC4 Setup Script

The `get-cvc4-linux.sh` script in the source repository sets up CVC4 for use with uclid5. To use this script, run `source get-cvc4-linux.sh` from the root directory of the uclid5 source repository. This script will download [CVC4 1.8](https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4) binaries from GitHub and add it to your `PATH`.

#### 4. Delphi Setup Script

The `get-delphi-linux.sh` script in the source repository sets up Delphi for use with uclid5. To use this script, run `source get-delphi-linux.sh` from the root directory of the uclid5 source repository. This script will download [Delphi](https://github.com/polgreen/delphi) binaries from GitHub and add it to your `PATH`.

### Compiling uclid5

If all goes well, running update, clean, compile and test in sbt from the uclid5 directory should do the trick. The command to do all this is:

    $ sbt update clean compile "set fork:=true" test

If compilation and tests pass, you can build a universal package.

    $ sbt universal:packageBin

This will create uclid/target/universal/uclid-0.9.5.zip, which contains the uclid binary in the bin/ subdirectory. Unzip this file, and add it to your path.

## Installing and Running uclid5

    $ unzip uclid-0.9.5.zip
    $ cd uclid-0.9.5
    $ export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/bin

Now you can run uclid using the 'uclid' command. For example:

    $ uclid examples/tutorial/ex1.1-fib-model.ucl
